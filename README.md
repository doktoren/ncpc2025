# Data structures and algorithms for programming competitions

I'm participating in [The Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest 2025](https://nordic.icpc.io/ncpc2025/)

This repository contains helper data structures and algorithms.
They're intended to be printed and manually typed as needed during the contest.

[docs-generator](./docs-generator/) is a script for generating a printable document per programming language.
